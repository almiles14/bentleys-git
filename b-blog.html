<h1>Bentley's Blog</h1>

       <h3>Hello everyone. This is the place I can jot down the strange
   things that happen in my life. Laugh and cry with me while I desperately try
   to make sense of the things that happen to me and my pal,
   <span class="little"><a href="little dog's-home-page.html">Little Dog
   </a></span>, while living in this world run by my
   two humans.</h3>

          <p>The past few days the humans have been acting weird.
    The short one, Al, hasn't gone to work for several days. She has also been
    bringing these scary cardboard boxes into our house. I think those boxes
    are trying to kill me, so I have been trying to sneak by them if I can't
    avoid them altogether. Al keeps putting the things from around the house in
    the boxes. Some times she takes this noisy paper stuff, that is also scary,
    and buries the little things from around the house before putting those in
    the boxes too. The house is looking more and more bare. I think I've seen
    this behavior before with these humans. When the taller human, Emily, comes
    home, leaves again with Al and returns with the big moving truck, my
    suspicions are validated, we are migrating to a new house.

  <p>The humans are at it again they started early this morning putting all
    those boxes in the large truck. It is so hot today but they
    don't seem to care. It makes me nervous when I cant see them. Why can't I
    be near them all the time? What if they forget to feed me?
